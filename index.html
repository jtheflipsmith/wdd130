                <p>Hello! I am currently working full time as well as enrolled in I am 28 years old, and am married to the love of my life. I am looking forward to being a dad. This is an essental step in my journey of providing a life for my family. In terms of things I enjoy, I would have to say that drawing is at the top, I also love biking, swimming, and reading fiction books. I am the first boy of six kids, and I love my family. I got really close to my siblings since we were all homeschooled, at least until I graduated, then a few of my sisters and one brother decided to finiish their highschool at an actual school. I recently got a job at a construction company and have been using that as a means to pay for my schooling and to keep my wife and I in the city. Ultimately I would like to become a computer software developer, and help influence current and future trends in media. I have spent most of my life in Canada, though the few places I have traveled have been pretty interesting. China as an example was very exotic and different from what I was used to. I spent a lot of time admiring their landscape and archatecture. It is so much more ancient then Canada in terms of development.</p>
